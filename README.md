# Wura's-website
My personal website built with love and code.


## Getting Started
- Clone this repo
- cd to the root of the project
- From the root, run `npm install` to install all packages
- From the root, run `node server.js` to start the app -> `http://localhost:8000`

## Things to note
- This project was built in 2017 and a couple of things may be obsolete/deprecated. No current plans are being made to maintain this project because I currently have no need for it.
- The `game` menu is a work in progress that never happened because life happened. lol. So there isn't much to see on that page because I never got to it.
- The contact form at the footer will break when you try to send a message because the email transporter auth has been removed. You can populate the fields [line 3-4 in routes.js] with your own info to get a feel of how it works
